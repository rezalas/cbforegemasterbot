Thanks:

	This project exists in great part due to the efforts of hard working men and women around the world creating and sharing their
efforts with all of us. I'd like to thank the team working on Discord.Net, CoreRCON, Serilog, and certainly not least the .Net Core
team and .Net Foundation. Their work powers this bot to a great degree and as such should be recognized.
